Tic Tac Toe Game fom github for socket example
socket.io included but not used 

Most From Stackoverflow (We ported it from javascript to java): 
"double relativeIntersectY = (Paddles[0].getCurrY()+(Paddles[0].getHeight()/2)) - location[1];
                double normalizedRelativeIntersectionY = (relativeIntersectY/(Paddles[0].getHeight()/2));
                double bounceAngle = normalizedRelativeIntersectionY * 75;
                double ballVx = (((movementSpeed)*Math.cos(bounceAngle)) );
                double ballVy = (((movementSpeed)*-Math.sin(bounceAngle)));

Removed all external code
