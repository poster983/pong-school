I'm going to try to implement local multiplayer, i.e., 2 players on the same keyboard
I want to get the speed of the ball and paddle working well
I want to change the spawning behavior of the ball, to make it spawn from the side that was scored on
I want to try adding obstacles in the board to spice up the game


Joseph's Stuff:
I am going to use sockets to send movement data to each client
I am going to create a client and server code.
